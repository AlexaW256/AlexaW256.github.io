                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>
                This was supposed to be a fighting game, similar to smash, but 
                I ran out of time and now it's a fight until death kind of
                game. I made this as a joke, as a result of the internet meme 
                phenomenon of "chads" and I stuck with it.   
                </p>
                <h2>Randomization</h2>
                
                <p>
                The spawning location of the star, the damage the player
                deals and recieves, and the health of the enemies are 
                randomized. 
                </p>
                <h3>Difficulty</h3>
                <p>
                The score keeping, as displayed in the left corner, is an 
                indication of the difficulty. As the score increases, the
                time interval of attacks get shorter, and the damage increases.
                </p>
                <h2>Losing</h2>
                <p>
                Eventually when the player runs out of health, the user is 
                given a death screen to signify that the game is over.
                </p>
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <h3>But Why?</h3>
                <p>Well, this game was created for a required project, but I chose
                this fighting style because it's what I'm familiar with and its
                what I enjoy</p>
                <h3>What are some good things?</h3>
                <p>I suppose the addition of abilities was something that I'm quite
                happy with, as abilities add extra flair. Another positive thing 
                was the addition of an energy system that limits the use of abilities</p>
                <h3>Obstacles?</h3>
                <p>Right off the bat, I could see that Scratch has some problems with parallel
                computing. Sometimes, if there are too many blocks that react to the
                same event, some blocs simply won't run. Additionally, it was quite 
                annoying to have to create public variables for sprites, because I 
                wouldn't be able to access the health variable for a particular
                sprite with a method.</p>
                <h3>More Time?</h3>
                <p>If I had more than a couple of days, I would have cleared up
                all of the bugs in the animation, I would have added a leveling sysytem,
                more stages, and more enemies. Overall, the game is quite buggy and
                not all that fun, but with time it could potentially resemble a
                playable game.</p>
                <h2>Algorithms!</h2>
                <p>There are certainly mainy algorithms that were used to create this game,
                the most noteable being the frame animation algorithm.</p>
                <img src="scratc.PNG" width=100%>
                <p>While this algorithm was initially going to play until a stop condition,
                it was easier to simply cycle through all of the frames and stop this
                algorithm when a button was not clicked. The frame count keeps track
                of the frame that is currently being played, the boolean acts as the stopping condition,
                and the start and stop parameters indicate the starting and stopping
                frames.</p>
